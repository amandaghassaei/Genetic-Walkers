Processing-Linkage-Generator
===============

mechanical walking mechanisms designed in Processing, exported to STL for 3D Printing via ModelBuilder Library

<p>A very long time ago, I started writing an Instructable about generating a 3D printable linkage from processing.  Eventually that project grew in other directions and I abandoned all my Processing code.  I already wrote a lot about it and since it might be useful to someone, I've posted it on <a href="https://github.com/amandaghassaei/Genetic-Walkers">Github</a> and have included some explanation here. </p><p>The next several steps will describe the Processing sketch used to transform the information describing the geometry of a leg into a 3D printable model of the leg.  This is still very much a work in progress, but it is a nice example of how to use the <a href="https://github.com/mariuswatz/modelbuilder">Modelbuilder library</a>.</p>
